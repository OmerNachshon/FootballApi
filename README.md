# FootballApi
FootballApi for 21-22 season :)

A little Backend project in my spare time .
By using Flask API , Ngrok and 2 datasets from Kaggle , I'v created an API thats exposed to the world , which can take a query in the URL:


xxxx/player/?value=PLAYER_NAME    -> ex : real_madrid or real
xxxx/team/?value=TEAM_NAME    -> ex: lionel_messi or messi 

full name works better in case there are some players with the same first name of instance :)

Enjoy!
